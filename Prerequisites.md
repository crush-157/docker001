# Hands On Lab - Prerequisites

## This document outlines some example Docker Engine environment installs that should be completed, prior to starting the Hands on Lab Participant Guide.  

These examples are only a few of the many that you might utilize to create a Docker Environment.


### Use Oracle VirtualBox

* [Get and Install VirtualBox for your Laptop](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/virtualbox/overview/index.html)
* Create a Linux VM with VirtualBox
* [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/)

### Docker Engine on Windows:

* [See Install Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)

### Docker Engine on Mac:

* [See Install Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)

### Docker Engine on Oracle Linux:

1. [Request An Oracle Cloud Trial](https://cloud.oracle.com/tryit)

2. [See the first 3 sections of this blog for a quick install on an Oracle Linux 6 Cloud VM](https://community.oracle.com/community/cloud_computing/infrastructure-as-a-service-iaas/oracle-container-cloud-service/blog/2017/01/26/the-fast-path-to-a-private-docker-registry-on-oracle-public-cloud)

> *Note - after you have your Docker environment built, you will be ready to start the [Participant Guide](../master/Participant-Guide.md)*
